ruff check .
```

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style

* Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting
* Use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting
* Write docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules
* Use type hints for all function parameters and return values

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Testing

* Write tests for all new functionality
* Maintain or improve code coverage (currently at 82%)
* Use pytest for all tests
* Mock external API calls - don't make real requests in unit tests
* Use the `@pytest.mark.integration` decorator for tests that require API keys
