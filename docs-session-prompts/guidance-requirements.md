- Performance benchmarks and metrics
- Brand guidelines and visual standards
- Analytics and measurement strategy

### Phase 2: Quality Assurance (Before Session 3)
- Content review and quality control processes
- Error handling and edge case documentation
- Accessibility standards and testing procedures

### Phase 3: Long-term Sustainability (Before Session 6)
- Content versioning and maintenance strategy
- Advanced search configuration
- Community integration planning

## Request for Specific Guidance

**Most Critical Need:** Content standards and format specifications - having exact templates and formats would dramatically improve implementation speed and consistency.

**Second Priority:** Performance benchmarks and metrics - specific targets would enable objective quality assurance and professional deployment standards.

**Third Priority:** Brand guidelines and visual standards - would ensure professional appearance and brand consistency throughout the documentation.

This guidance would transform the prompts from "good direction" to "precise implementation instructions" and significantly improve the final documentation quality and professional appearance.
